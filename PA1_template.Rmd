## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity<-read.csv('activity.csv')
library(dplyr)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Calculate the total steps:
```{r}
totals<-summarise_each(group_by(na.omit(data), date), funs(sum))
totals
```
Create a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day:
```{r}
hist(totals$steps, main = 'Total Steps', col = 'orange')
```
Calculate and report the mean of the total number of steps taken per day:
```{r}
mean(totals$steps)
```
Calculate and report the median of the total number of steps taken per day:
```{r}
median(totals$steps)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
